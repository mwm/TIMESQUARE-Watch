A binary - or packed/binary coded decimal - face for the Adafruit times
square watch.

When running, there are four displays that you toggle between by
pushing the left button.

    Year: The rows going down the matrix are:
        Century
	Year in century
	Day of the week (Sunday = 1) and month
	Day of the month
	----- Unused
	Hour. Either am/pm (two LEDs) & 12 hour or 24 hour
	Minute
	Second

    Month: Every other row, starting at the top:
        Day of the week and month (as above)
	Day of the month
	Hour
	Minute 
	Bottom row is a cylon cycle of once per second.

    Day: Every other row, starting at the _second_ row:
        Day of the month
	Hour (as above)
	Minute
	Second

    Hour:
	Hour, in 2x2 blocks on the 2nd and 3rd row, 12 hour display
	Minute, on the fifth row
	Second, on the seventh row

Note that the displays may be either pure binary, or packed (aka
binary coded) decimal, where two-digit values (except months and
12-hour time) are displayed as two decimal digits. The high order
digit is in the first three bits of the row, and the low order digit
is the last four bits. This is toggled with the right button.
